Irwin 1993 - Assessing winter dietary quality in bighorn sheep via fecal nitrogen 

Experiments on bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in order to link fecal nitrogen concentration to dietary quality 

Controlled conditions : 3 female adults, 4 diets 
%N in food and feces (no raw data for feces) -> linear regression 

Wild conditions : measure of %N in feces and estimates of %N in food -> linear regression

Data included:
- Diet nitrogen evaluated using the bite count method
- Fecal nitrogen using Kjeldahl method
