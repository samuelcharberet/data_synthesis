Sitters 2014 - Interactions between C : N : P stoichiometry and soil macrofauna control dung decomposition of savanna herbivores

They measure the decomposition rate of the dejection of different savannah herbivores in the presence or not of dung beetles

C: N: P varies according to the species because it reflects the differences in feeding strategies and digestive physiology

Trait data: digestive physiology

Data taken in the data_availability -> the excel sheet: dung nutrient overview

for the species of Thryonomys it can be as much Thryonomys gregorianus as Thryonomys swinderianus
But the most probable is T. swinderianus in kenya so we made the choice of this one
