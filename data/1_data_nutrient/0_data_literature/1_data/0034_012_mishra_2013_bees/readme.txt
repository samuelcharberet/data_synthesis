Mishra 2013 - Inorganic nitrogen derived from foraging honey bees could have adaptive benefits for the plants they visit

Bee (Apic mellifera) frass C, N, NH4+-N, NO3-N, uric acid-N, urea-N, P, Ca, K, Cu, Mg, S, Fe, Zn and B.
Estimation of egestion rates.
Egestion rates were calculated as follow:
540 mg/(m²*day*500g of bees) * 3.24 m² * 2 = 3498 mg /(day*kg of bees)
