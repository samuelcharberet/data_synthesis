table 1: total waste composition of captive hippos

table 3: C, N, P composition of zoo food, zoo feces, zoo urine, zoo total waste, field food, field total waste
NB: data field format: wet season-dry season

table S2: C, N, P composition of zoo food

text: stoichio C: N: P of zoo food, zoo feces, zoo urine (estimated), zoo total waste, field total waste, field feces


Anne-CÃ©cile:

in the "table_S2_supporting_information": the quantity of C, N and P is given in (g) 
so we divide it by the quantity of Food Dry Mass (kg) to have the quantity of g_kg_DM ingested per day

in addition: the quantity in (kg) of food Dry Mass (food_dw) is for 1 individual, 
as we have the mass of these individuals, I divide in the Excel 58.8 / 1763.666667 kg 
(the average mass of the three hippos calculated by Lucie) to have the quantity consumed "kg_DM_kg_ind_day"
