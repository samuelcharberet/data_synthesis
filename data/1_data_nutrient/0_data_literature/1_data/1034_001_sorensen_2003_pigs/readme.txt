Sorensen 2003 - Dietary effects on the composition of pig slurry and on the plant utilization of pig slurry nitrogen

Urine and feces were collected from growing pigs and dry sows* with several diets and analysed for the composition, including total N. 

Diet composition is also given (without total N).

The goal was to test the influence of diet on slurry composition and the dynamics of N during storage, slurry decomposition in soil and availability of N for plants.

Data must be from 1999 (late) as field experiment occurred in spring 2000 and there was a 20 weeks slurry storage before.

I took only total N and pH data as other data are not clear.
Nevertheless, it might be possible to calculate total N in food (cf. file attached)


*"dry sows"  = all sows not producing milk (from weaning until farrowing)
