Saastamoinen 2020 - The Effect of Diet Composition on the Digestibility and Fecal Excretion of Phosphorus in Horses: A
Potential Risk of P Leaching?

P, Mg, Ca ingestion rate and egestion rate data on both feed and feces on 6 mares and 6 different diets. 
Author erratum provided.

Samuel: It seems that the 6 hares recieved different diets in every period, for 4 periods. So not all mares recieved all diets.  
And a particular diet should have been recieved by 4 mares.

Thus, Samuel did not include mares BW or age average which is computed on the 6 horse, not the ones that recieved each diet. 
Samuel did not include pooled SEM, because it is the error of the mean rather than the error of each observation.

There are two parts in the data: one corresponding to data with food and feces on 4 mares, and one corresponding to data on the 6 mares
