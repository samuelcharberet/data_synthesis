Kadamannaya 2009 - Leaf litter ingestion and assimilation by two endemic pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera)

Feeding experiments in the lab with 2 sepcies of pill millipedes and litter leaves in several plant species combinations 
Measures : 
- comsumption rate, growth rate, food conversion efficiency
- for leaves and millipedes feces : Content of total phenolics, organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium, and C/N ratio
For C:N ratio organic carbon values are obviously been used but probably OC is ~Ctot here. David didn't collect the OC values as Ctot but maybe we could...
