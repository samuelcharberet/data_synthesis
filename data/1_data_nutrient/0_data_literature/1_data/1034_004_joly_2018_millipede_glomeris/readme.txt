Joly 2018 - Litter conversion into detritivore faeces reshuffles the quality control over C and N dynamics during decomposition

Raw data from Dryad are available in raw_data
Samuel took the raw data in Phys&Chem_characteristics. There are C, N and CN ratio data on food and feces in measure triplicates.
Samuel ran the 1034_004_joly_2018_data_wrangling R code to obtain Phys&Chem_characteristics_lengthened_aggregated.
The code computes averages over the three measures replicates and lengthens data.
