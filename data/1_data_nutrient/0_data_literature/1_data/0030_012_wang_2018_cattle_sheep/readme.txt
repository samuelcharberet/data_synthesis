Wang 2018 - Feces nitrogen release induced by different large herbivores in a dry grassland
(article published in 2018 but supplementary data dated 2017 with another DOI)

C, N and CN of cattle and sheep in the raw data file 'Feces_Chem_Fiber', lengthened using the R script '0030_012_wang_2018_data_wrangling'.
Samuel excluded food data as it is based on behavioural observations and not feeding trial. 

Analysis of diet, feces composition and decomposition for cattles and sheeps in the field.
3 blocks of 3 plots : no grazing, grazing by cattles, grazing by sheeps.
Plots are presumably temporary enclosure. They are located in an area with a long history of free-range grazing
by domestic livestock

There are detailed data in the diet file but they can't be linked to individuals so I didn't report this detailed data in the template. 
Moreover diet observations lack details. One "replicate" in the file obviously refers to multiple observations but on the same individual every day ?
So, in the template I put the composition for each feces sample but with the mean diet species composition and CN.
