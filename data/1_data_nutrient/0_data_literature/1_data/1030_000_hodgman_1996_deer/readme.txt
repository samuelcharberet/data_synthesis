Hodgman 1996 - Monitoring mule deer diet quality and intake with fecal indices

11 digestion trials with black-tailed (Odocoileus hemionus
columbianus Richardson) and mule deer (O. h. hemionus
Rafmesque) to examine relationships between several chemical
constituents of deer feces (i.e., fecal nitrogen, fecal 2,6-
diaminopimelic acid (DAPA), fecal neutral detergent fiber
(NDF), fecal acid detergent fiber, and fecal acid detergent lignin)
and dry matter intake, digestible energy, digestible energy
intake, diet crude protein content, crude protein digestibility,
and digestible crude protein intake.

Gives average bodyweight, average intake rate and average fecal N.

Crude protein was estimated based on macro-Kjeldahl method, which measures N.
Samuel therefore recomputed food N based on the 6.25 classic conversion factor for crude protein, 
even though it is not explicitely stated.
The egestion rate is tricky to compute.
