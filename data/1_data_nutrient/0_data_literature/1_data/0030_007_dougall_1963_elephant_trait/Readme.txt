Dougall 1963 - On the chemical composition of elephant faeces

Analysis of 11 feces produced by one elephant during one day in national park : especially composition in N, Silica, Ca, P, Na, K
data for N, CF, total ash and Ca composition in another sample from an unknown elephant six month earlier.
David didn't take into account Silica as it's not Si element (Silicon).

David supposed the species was Loxodonta africana. Indeed, now it is aknowledged that the two african subspecies are actually 2 species. Only L.africana occur in the study area.
