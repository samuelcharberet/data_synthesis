Barnes 2019 - Predators buffer the effects of variation in prey nutrient content for nutrient deposition

Food and egesta C, N, and C/N data for a species of spider. Dryad raw data for egesta with 77 CN data on 52 spiders (on the 58 total).

Samuel reexcracted the data from the dryad repository for both food and excreta.
The raw data can be found in the raw_data file, Data from Predators buffer the effects of, in the sheets elemegest and elemprey.
1034_003_barnes_2019_data_wrangling.r is a R script allowing to exctract and lengthen data.



Datascraping of the values in figure 3.b by lucie using datathief for the food (prey composition)

And calculation of the means and standard errors for the excreta (excreta) corresponds to figure 4.b
