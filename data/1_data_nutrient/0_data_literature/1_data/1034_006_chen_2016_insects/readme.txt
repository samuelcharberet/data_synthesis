Raw data sent by Brian Forschler (bfor@uga.edu) and Angela Myer  (angela.myer888@gmail.com).
'FrassStudy_MasterFile' in the sheet SAS_IMPORT_KruskalWallis. Other informations are found in the supplementary data.
the food_ID is 'pinewood' because it is not linked to a specific sample of pinewood, and because we have several samples of pinewood with raw data.
It may require to compute averages.
