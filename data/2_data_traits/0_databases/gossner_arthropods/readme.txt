Gossner 2016 - A summary of eight traits of Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Araneae, occurring in grasslands in Germany

In this paper, we summarize information on body size, dispersal ability, feeding guild and specialization (within herbivores), 
feeding mode, feeding tissue (within herbivorous suckers), plant part (within herbivorous chewers), 
endophagous lifestyle (within herbivores), and vertical stratum use for 1,230 species of Coleoptera, Hemiptera (Heteroptera, Auchenorrhyncha), 
Orthoptera (Saltatoria: Ensifera, Caelifera), and Araneae, sampled by sweep-netting between 2008 and 2012. 
We compiled traits from various literature sources and complemented data from reliable internet sources and the authorsâ€™ experience.
