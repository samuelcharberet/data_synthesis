COMBINE: a COalesced Mammal dataBase of INtrinsic and Extrinsic traits

Information on 54 traits for 6,234 extant and recently extinct mammal species, including information on morphology, 
reproduction, diet, biogeography, life habit, phenology, behavior, home range, and density. 
Additionally, we calculated other relevant traits such as habitat and altitudinal breadths for all species and dispersal for terrestrial non-volant species. 
All data are compatible with the taxonomies of the IUCN Red List v. 2020-2 and PHYLACINE v. 1.2.
