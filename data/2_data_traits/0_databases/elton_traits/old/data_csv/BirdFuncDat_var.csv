Diet-Certainty;Dietary relevance score reliability;Character;A – Highly certain that the source is reliable and has provided accurate diet information. B – Reasonably confident that source is reliable, however information on relative proportion of each diet category making up the whole diet is possibly uncertain. C – Quality of source diet estimate unclear or inferred from a specific congeneric species with good sources. D1, D2 – Species-level information missing and value is that typical for genus (D1) or family (D2).
