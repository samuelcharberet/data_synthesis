# Does egestion and excretion chemical composition varies with species traits in terrestrial animals

Here, we combine excretion and egestion chemical composition data with species-level trait data (e.g. bodymass, diet) and confront both to investigate correlations.

data used for these analyses are found in the "1_data" directory.

The R functions running the analyses are found in the "R" repository and their execution order is specified through the "_targets.r" file and execution is specified by targets::tar_make() in the R console.

Output figures and statistical results can be found in the "2_output" directory.
