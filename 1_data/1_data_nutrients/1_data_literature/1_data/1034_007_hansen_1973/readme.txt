Hansen 1973 - Determination of the Metabolic Faecal Nitrogen and the Endogenous Urinary Nitrogen on Mink

Experiments on mink (mustelidae), but no species name provided. 
The species is likely Neovison vison so Samuel assumed it. 

Individuals are fed various diets. Nitrogen in food, feces and urine are provided.
The data are found in two graphs requiring data scrapping with DATATHIEF. 
For both figure, we lack some of the 113 points, because some may lay on the regression bar or on each other, thus hidding them.
