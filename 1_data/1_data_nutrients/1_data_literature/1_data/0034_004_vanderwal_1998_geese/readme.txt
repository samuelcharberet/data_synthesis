van der Wal 1998 - Goose droppings as food for reindeer

in Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen (79°569N, 11°579E)

two small-scale experiments were performed in July and August 1993. 

what type of feed enriched by goose droppings and which most useful for reindeer

Samuel did not include food data, as the actual feeding of geese of the resource has not been observed and is rather infered.
Samuel assumed that he sample type was guano rather than feces because the organism is a bird.
I treated each observation as coming from a different feces .


0,0696864 kg_feces_ind_day = 0.952 g_dw_feces * 73.2 feces_droping_day * 10^3 (data à la fin du papier). Samuel removed this data as it is computed rather than measured.
