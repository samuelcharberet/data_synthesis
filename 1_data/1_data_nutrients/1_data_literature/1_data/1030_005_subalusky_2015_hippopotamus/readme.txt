Subalusky 2015 - The hippopotamus conveyor belt: vectors of carbon and nutrients from terrestrial grasslands to aquatic systems in
sub-Saharan Africa

Included data (zoo):
- Ingestion and egestion rates on 3 hippos (remaining feces + suspended organic matter = total amount of feces, classic estimation of ingestion rate)
- C, N, P of food
- C, N, P of feces on 1 male hippos


Warning: Field intake data is taken from (Clauss et al., 2004, 2007; Schwarm et al., 2006).
Field mass of excreted or egested C, N, P is estimated using an equation based on assumptions, not measured.
Samuel included only ingestion and egestion rates computed on the three hippos, not the ingestion and egestion rate, 
as a choice had to be made between stock and rate data, as rate data are computed from stock data, and we want to avoid data inflation.
Moreover, urine data were not included because they are esimated not measured.
Finally, field data were not included because they are based on literature rather than original measures.
