Emerson 2007 - Composition of guano produced by frugivorous sanguivorous and insectivorous bats

Analysis of the composition of the guano of 3 species of bats with a different diet (frugivorous, blood-eating, insectivorous)
The sampler was careful to take only faeces and not urine.
For each species, the guano was harvested in 3 different places in the USA (the location entered in the template is the center of the USA - details in the article)

table 1: composition of guano (C, N, P in particular)

table 2: C: N, N: P, C: P ratios (data not entered in the template, misunderstanding on how to obtain them >> mail in progress - waiting for the response)
