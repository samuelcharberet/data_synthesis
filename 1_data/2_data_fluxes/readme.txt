This dataframe contains relative nutrients fluxes of animal consumption and waste production for five nutrients: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na; as well as food's concentration in these nutrients.

This is encapsulated in the apparent digestibility of nutrients (e.g. aD N for apparent digestibility of N, nitrogen).
Part of this data was kindly provided by Marcus Clauss (mclauss@vetclinics.uzh.ch, 2023).
